    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Kedar, rhymes with cheddar, and I'm a <strong>photographer</strong> and <strong>front end
        dev</strong> intern at <a href="http://dirigiblestudio.com/">Dirigible Studio</a> here in Madison, Wisco.
    </p>

    <p>I think it's important to help make the internet a <strong>beautiful place</strong>, whether that be through
      words, photography, or web design, and I'm excited to have found a community at <a
        href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> that shares my belief.</p>

    <p>I also think it's important to push yourself and <strong>learn</strong> one new thing every day, no matter what
      that may be. Did you know a duel between three people is called a <a

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I call <a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/1855_Colton_Map_of_Wisconsin_-_Geographicus_-_Wisconsin-colton-1855.jpg">Madison,
        Wisconsin</a> my home, the land of dairy (Get outta here, California!). My favorite part about <b>Madison</b> is
      that we're a city built around a large <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">university</a>. There's a vibrant crowd here
      that keeps this city bold and <strong>progressive</strong>.

      The isles of <a

      in every grocery store aren't so bad either.

    <p>You can find me in the city, <strong>camera</strong> in hand, documenting the stories around me, or in little
      cafe's writing about my daily <a href="http://www.kedarjoyner.com/blog/">adventures</a> and the people I meet.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love to explore new cities, take photographs, eat tacos, catnap with my cat, bike to big lakes, hold hands,
      play video games, dance in hay lofts, spend weekends with my grandpa, drink good <a
        href="http://www.proof66.com/whiskey/eagle-rare-10yr-bourbon.html">whiskey</a>, and sit outside all night on
      porches.</p>

    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>A professional turtle racer. Just kidding, I would love to be a full-time <strong>creative</strong> who's given
      an array of responsibilities in front-end work, photography, design, and whatever else comes my way.</p>

    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>My husband and I recently roadtripped through Arizona listening to the band <a
        href="http://houndmouth.com/">Houdmouth</a>. I don't know what it is about them, but they make you want to keep
      driving and driving. Start with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8">"Sedona"</a> first.
